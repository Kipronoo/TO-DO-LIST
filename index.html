        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>This project was inspired by my personal struggle to manage tasks efficiently across different areas of life. As a software engineering student, balancing school assignments, personal projects, and daily tasks became overwhelming. Traditional task management tools often lacked flexibility or features that suited my needs, so I decided to build a tool that would provide a more intuitive way to organize tasks.

The development journey for the TO-DO LIST application began with identifying the core features I needed to stay productive: clear task management, efficient filtering, and timely notifications. Over several weeks, I worked on implementing these features while also improving my skills in web development, API integration, and user interface design. This project is a portfolio piece, developed as part of my learning journey at Holberton School, where I explored both front-end and back-end development technologies.</p>
